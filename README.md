# Amazon Product Pricing and Review Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Amazon product data to understand pricing patterns,
discount strategies, and customer rating behavior using Python.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Study the impact of discounts on customer ratings
- Identify top-rated and most-reviewed products
- Compare actual price vs discounted price

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Converted price, discount, and rating columns to numeric format
- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Prepared data for analysis and visualization

## 📊 Key Insights
